TODO
====

- [~] Finish inbound checkups
- [ ] Imrpove svg graph
- [ ] Load/cost testing
- [ ] Production deploy
- [ ] Ensure CORS is configured correctly
- [ ] Refactor routes/checkups.ts
    - It should be split into a lib or db file
    - We currently share the data model between inbound and outbound. This is to reduce duplication in the codebase. It would be nice to have separate tables with minimal duplication in the codebase.
- [ ] Change favicon
- [ ] Add a testing framework
